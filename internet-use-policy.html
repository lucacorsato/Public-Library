<h1 align="center"><strong>Internet Use Policy</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>PURPOSE</strong></h3>
<p>To  clarify the use of Internet resources by staff and the public in the Santa  Clarita Public Library.</p>
<h3><strong>POLICY</strong></h3>
<p>The  Santa Clarita Public Library endeavors to provide collections, resources, and services  that meet the cultural, informational, recreational, and educational needs of  the diverse communities it serves.   Within this context, the Library offers access to the Internet for both  staff and members of the public.</p>
<p>The  Internet is a global resource.  Resources  available on the Internet supplement and compliment the collection and  resources available at Library facilities.   The Library does not monitor and has no control over the information  accessed through the Internet.  The  Internet may contain material of a controversial nature.  Users should note that not all Internet  sources provide accurate, complete or current information.</p>
<p>All  Internet access stations and the Library’s wireless network are filtered to  prevent access to materials deemed by law to be harmful to a minor in  compliance with the Children’s Internet Protection Act.  Patrons who are 18 years of age and over may  request unfiltered access.  Access for  all patrons under age 18 will be filtered.   Filtering software may not block all material users find offensive.  Parents and legal guardians are responsible  for any and all Internet use by minors.</p>
<p>Library  Staff are to use the Internet for library related purposes only.  </p>
<p>All  Internet use is subject to Santa Clarita Public Library Conduct Policy.  </p>
<p>Patrons  who observe violations of the Santa Clarita Library Conduct Policy should  contact Library staff immediately.  </p>
<p>Patrons  are expected to adhere to all rules governing the use of the Internet in  libraries, including the duration and frequency of sessions.  Patrons who violate library policy regarding  the use of the Internet, or who behave in a disruptive manner will be asked to  either modify their use appropriately or discontinue such usage.</p>
<p>As  is the case with any electronic media system provided by the City, Library  users should not have an expectation of privacy when using any form of  electronic media.</p>
